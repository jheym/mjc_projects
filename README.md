# What's in here?

* Most of the programs I have written throughout my lower division courses at Modesto Junior College
* My Calculus 3 project which is a paper showcasing a physics simulation I came up with using concepts from multivariable calculus and Desmos. **Note: If viewing the calculus 3 project you will have to download the pdf in order to access the Desmos simulations and 3d graphs.** 
* Also includes some python scripts from the MIT OCW Intro to Programming in Python Course (6.0001)
